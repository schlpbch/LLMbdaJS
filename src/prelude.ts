/**
 * Prelude definitions — §C.5 (fix), §5.1 (quarantine), §E.2
 * (robust_endorse), §E.3 (bounded_endorse).
 *
 * Why these are LLMbda closures and not plain TypeScript functions:
 * `quarantine`/`robust_endorse`/`bounded_endorse` are meant to be
 * callable from *agent-generated* code — an LLM response that gets
 * parsed and evaluated (§3.3's ⇓-Recv) can only call things that exist
 * as named bindings in the object language's environment. A host-side
 * TS helper function is invisible to generated code; a prelude entry in
 * `Model.preludeSource` is not — it's merged into scope for every recv
 * (see `getPreludeEnv`/`mergeEnv` in evaluator.ts) and available to the
 * top-level program too via `runProgram`.
 *
 * Each export below is a *builder* — a function returning an Expr —
 * rather than a bare Expr, because `bounded_endorse` needs its trust
 * domain baked in at construction time (§E.3 requires the domain be a
 * fixed, static list, or the log₂n leakage bound it's justified by
 * doesn't hold), and a single universal prelude entry can't do that.
